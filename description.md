My friends and I are doing this case study about digital healthcare. 
We are proposing an idea of building a new OS system for a hospital so that there are more secure servers to store patient data. 
One of our components is a notification system where the OS monitors for hackers/unauthorized entry, and sends a pop up notification to the IT, so that they donâ€™t have to physically monitor for it themselves 24/7. 
We wanted to make a small code to just demonstrate and give a little idea of how it would work.
